However, this is nowhere near specific enough to be useful. That's because though Friday may have the lowest number of total crossings (45476), it doesn't help determine if westbound or eastbound is better on a given day. It also doesn't take into account that perhaps everyone only goes eastbound on Friday. Therefore yes, going westbound would be best, and yes, the total amount of people crossing is low, but it fails is properly determining the best day to cross.\n"

It then calculates the average amount of westbound traffic for a given day (average crossings on mondays headed west was 1698). The analysis then uses these averages to determine which day had the lowest amount of average crossings, and that was the metric used to determine the \"best\" day to cross the bridge headed westbound, which turned out to be Sunday, with a total of 849 westbound crossings on average. Coincidentally, Sunday was also the best day to cross headed east, with a total of 672 crossings on average. This actually makes some sense, as there are NFL games on Sundays, Church meets on Sundays, and generally speaking, Sunday is the laziest day of the week"
